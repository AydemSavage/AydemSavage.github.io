# How to host a resume on Github pages

This README will explain how to host your resume  on Github and style it using Markdown and Jekyll. I will also explain how these steps are directly correlated to the principles  in Andrew Etter's book _Modern Technical Writing_.

### Prerequisites
1. You should already have a resume formatted using Markdown. If you do not, you can follow a tutorial that will teach you how to use it, located under the [More Resources](#More-Resources) section.

## Step 1 - Create a Github account
To start doing any of this, we will need to first create an account. You can create a free account with [Github](https://github.com/join). Additionally, if you are a student, you will most likely be able to sign up using your school email which will grant you more features over the free version. These upgrades include: 
* Private repositories with more than 3 collaborators
* blah
* blah
* blah


## Step 2 - Create a repository
To create a repo (repository), we can go to the main page and click the green button titled "New". We can also go to our account page, click the _Repositories_ tab and then click the green "New" button.
When we arrive at the _Create a new repository_ page, we need to name our project **username.github.io**. It is **very important** that you name your repo this because this will let Github know that you are wanting to publicly host this website for others to see.
We can then check the _Add a README file_ button.


## Step 3 - Create a file called index.md
Put your resume in this file or upload your resume and call it index.md


## Step 4 - Use a static site generator to make resume look pretty
Go to your repo, then settings then scroll down to **GitHub Pages** and then click **Change theme**. Once here, you can choose a theme that you like best.

Better because we are able to easily update our resume without having to convert the work file to HTML or PDF and then uppload that. We can easily update our website
